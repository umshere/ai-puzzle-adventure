# AI-Assisted Creative Puzzle Adventure - Project Documentation Plan

## **Objective:**

Create a structured plan to execute the AI-powered **Creative Puzzle Adventure** game. The project will be broken into multiple documents to track progress and ensure smooth execution. This plan will also incorporate insights from deep research to guide future development.

## **Documents to be Created in Canvas:**

### 1. **Project Overview**

- High-level description of the game.
- Core mechanics & gameplay loop.
- AI-driven features & user-generated content (UGC).
- Monetization roadmap (freemium model, optional purchases, future monetization strategies).

### 2. **Technical Roadmap & To-Do List**

- Step-by-step plan for launching a local version.
- Breakdown of development phases.
- Immediate, short-term, and long-term tasks.
- AI-enhanced feature rollouts.

### 3. **Architecture Documentation**

- High-level architecture diagram (Mermaid).
- Breakdown of components:
  - Frontend (React, Phaser.js, UI framework choices).
  - Backend (Node.js, Express, database choice for level storage, AI processing).
  - AI module (procedural level generation, adaptive difficulty, content filtering).
- Deployment strategy for local, cloud-based, and production setups.

### 4. **API & Backend Services**

- API endpoint list (game logic, level creation, AI services, authentication).
- Integration of OpenRouter API tokens for AI services.
- Example API requests/responses for external AI calls.

### 5. **AI & Procedural Generation Design**

- Overview of AI-powered procedural content generation.
- Adaptive difficulty mechanism and player behavior tracking.
- AI-driven user content moderation.
- Future improvements (evolving AI to personalize game experience).

### 6. **Social & Multiplayer Features**

- Friend challenges and level-sharing mechanisms.
- Leaderboards and ranking systems.
- Community features (in-game events, content showcases).
- Future plans for real-time multiplayer.

### 7. **Monetization & Business Model**

- Phased monetization strategy.
- Non-intrusive ads, in-app purchases, and subscription models.
- Influencer and viral growth marketing ideas.
- Long-term revenue model roadmap.

### 8. **Comprehensive AI Code Generation Prompt**

- Detailed prompt for an AI coding assistant (Claude 3.7, Cline, or Root Cline).
- Expected output and structured project folders.
- Clear instructions for AI-generated scripts & testing environment.

## **Execution Plan:**

1. **Begin Documentation Process** â€“ Start filling out Canvas documents as per the structure above.
2. **Generate Code for Local Version** â€“ Use AI coding assistant to implement a basic version.
3. **Validate AI-Generated Code** â€“ Run, test, and refine generated implementations.
4. **Deploy & Iterate** â€“ Develop cloud-compatible versions based on research insights.
5. **Enhance with AI Features** â€“ Expand procedural generation, adaptive difficulty, and user-generated content tools.
6. **Implement Monetization & Social Features** â€“ Gradually introduce revenue and viral mechanics.
7. **Prepare for Market Launch** â€“ Scale and refine the game based on player feedback.

## **Action Items for Today:**

- **Generate first versions of all documents in Canvas.**
- **Use AI to create the initial game prototype.**
- **Validate API token integration for OpenRouter AI services.**
- **Ensure modularity for future AI enhancements.**

Once these documents are generated, we will move forward with implementation using an AI coding assistant. Letâ€™s start building! ðŸš€
